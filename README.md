# Image to Text Generator

This repository contains the Image to Text Generator project, which uses machine learning models to generate descriptive texts from images. The project utilizes the VisionEncoderDecoderModel from the Hugging Face library and features a user-friendly interface implemented with Streamlit.

## Project Description

- **Project Duration:** December 2023 - May 2024
- **Description:**
  - This Python project employs machine learning models to generate descriptive texts from images.
  - Developed an image-to-text conversion functionality using the VisionEncoderDecoderModel from the Hugging Face library.
  - Implemented a user interface with Streamlit to provide an interactive experience.
  - Leverages a pre-trained vision-language model to generate textual descriptions, successfully producing accurate and meaningful captions for the provided images.

## Features

- **Image Upload:** Upload images through a simple and intuitive user interface.
- **Text Extraction:** Extracts descriptive text from uploaded images using advanced machine learning models.
- **User Interface:** Streamlit-based interface for easy interaction with the application.

## Tools and Technologies Used
